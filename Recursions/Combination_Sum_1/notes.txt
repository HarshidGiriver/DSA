COMBINATION SUM — MUSCLE MEMORY NOTES

Problem idea:
Find all combinations whose sum = target.
Elements CAN be reused.

---

Function parameters:
index  → current position in array
target → remaining sum
curr   → current combination
ans    → final result list

---

BASE CASES (write first)

1. Success case
   If target == 0
   → add copy of curr to ans
   → return

2. Stop case
   If index == arr.length
   → return

---

CHOICES (always in this order)

1. PICK
   Condition:
   arr[index] <= target

Steps:

* add arr[index] to curr
* call recursion with SAME index
* subtract arr[index] from target
* remove last element (backtrack)

Memory rule:
Pick → stay at index

---

2. NOT PICK

Steps:

* call recursion with index + 1

Memory rule:
Skip → move forward

---

ORDER TO WRITE CODE (important)

1. target == 0
2. index == n
3. pick
4. backtrack
5. not pick

TIME COMPLEXITY
Exponential (backtracking)

SPACE COMPLEXITY
O(depth of recursion)
