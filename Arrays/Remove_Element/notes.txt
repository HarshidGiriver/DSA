**Notes — Remove Element (My Approach)**

* The goal is to remove all occurrences of a given value `val` from the array in-place and return the new length.
* I use a variable `result` to track the position where the next valid element should be placed.
* I traverse the array using a loop.
* If the current element is not equal to `val`, I copy it to `nums[result]` and increment `result`.
* This way, all valid elements are shifted to the front of the array.
* Elements equal to `val` are skipped automatically because they are never copied.
* At the end, `result` represents the count of elements that are not equal to `val`, which is returned as the new length.

**Time Complexity:** O(N)
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

**Key learning:**
Using a pointer (`result`) helps overwrite unwanted elements while keeping valid elements in order.
